1. [Exploring Survival on the Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic)

    This example is important because it is an R Notebook on Titanic data set. Titanic is considered as one of the Data Science 101 data set and this notebook provides a good exploratory data analysis. It is also a Kaggle Kernel, which is a very good source for this kind of example R codes. The notebook also covers feature engineering, missing data imputation and modeling.
